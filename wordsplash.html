        <h2 class="project-header">The Idea</h2>
        <p>As a Spanish learner, I thought it'd be fun to make myself a learning tool. I've come to realize that no matter what level I'm at, there’s never a shortage of new vocabulary to learn.  I wasn’t aiming to reinvent the wheel, but I wanted to make a flashcards app that offered something a little different than what's on the market.  And that would be to allow the user to pick their favorite photos among a given set of photos.  There's no science to back this up, but I wondered if by allowing the user to choose the photos that resonated with them most, that could aid in memory retention.</p>

        <h2>Coding & Challenges</h2>
        <p>I broke the project into smaller pieces and worked on translation first.  I initially used an API by Yandex as it was free and simple to set up.  But it was no longer free after several months so I switched to Microsoft’s Translation API.  Both were actually pretty straightforward to set up.  I then moved on to the photos feature and researched different search engine APIs.   I ended up choosing Microsoft as it too was free.  The first 10 images for any word that a user looked up would be requested.  With a bit of javascript, the user would then choose whichever photos they liked, and those would in turn be created into flashcards via a database save of the image urls.  When the user plays their flashcards, they would be played at random and the photo would be random as well.</p>
        <p>There wasn’t anything particularly complicated about this project, but I became much more comfortable working with different APIs and JSON.  I also got some good practice with Javascript and CSS animations.  In the future, I'd like to add a feature that allows users to upload their own photos.</p>
