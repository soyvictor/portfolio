      <p>Hi, I'm <span class="name">Victor</span>.</p>
      <p>My interest in programming comes from my belief that it is a powerful tool that can be used to rapidly create solutions that improve society and make everyday life easier. I have a passion for great web design, well thought out features, and good usability.</p>
      <!-- <p>You can take a look at my projects <a href src="#">here</a>.</p> -->
      <p>For inquiries, I can be contacted at vchiang7@gmail.com. I live in California but previously lived in Mexico City and New York.  I am open to opportunities that require relocation.</p>
